Just the big things.\n\nDoing that was kinda transformative — I felt less stress, and found guilt-free time for long-term programming projects that weren’t urgent but were important.\n\nA couple thoughts:\n\n 1. Laying things out like this gave me space to block out “work on Kiwi,” a project that I had months to work on — but was important. Previously, something like that would get lost on the day-of.\n 2. Having a way of seeing just the big things, instead of my to-do list that includes a lot of little things, gave me a way of declaring myself done with work for the day. This resulted in (shockingly) feelings of having free time after finishing the list for the day.\n 3. I could be intentional about moving tasks around based on how long they would take and how much time I thought I’d have that day.\n\nPerhaps you’re reading this and thinking that it’s an obvious idea. You are right — it is embarrassingly obvious. I knew vaguely that this was a good idea, but for some reason I’d never earnestly tried it.\n\nSeeing the tasks laid out in front of me quieted the part of my brain that worries about whether there would be enough time to get each thing done.\n\nI did this type of weekly planning for the rest of the semester — sometimes in Notion, sometimes in Nota, sometimes in Kinopio, but always the same format.

I built that out and launched it on Friday, and I really like how it came out!\n\nHere’s a video of it in action:\n\n0:00/1×\n\nA few fun facts about its implementation:\n\n * I call it the “bib” internally, because... of course.\n * After you create a task, the bib closes. If you open it again, the options you’ve selected are preserved. But after five seconds, they’re cleared out to defaults.\n * Clicking any of the toggles would take focus off the text input, but I manually put focus back into the text input to maintain the illusion and allow you to keep typing.\n * The cyan ring around the text input isn’t actually a CSS focus style for the text input (since the cursor focus leaves the text input for a moment when a toggle is clicked, for example). Instead, it’s a fake focus style that shows whenever the bib is open.\n * I put a transparent layer below the bib when it’s open, and clicking anywhere on that layer closes the bib again. Here’s a visualization with the transparent layer turned opaque:\n\n0:00/1×\n * This also created a perfect opportunity for a little plus button on each divider that opens the task composer pre-filled with the divider:\n\n0:00/1×",

            "plaintext": "I was trying to use the Tailwind CSS ring classes on an <input />, but they didn’t seem to work in iOS Safari.\n\nFinally, I figured out that you have to add the appearance-none class to the input to make the ring work!\n\nThis is because iOS adds a shadow to the input by default, and the Tailwind ring classes use a shadow under the hood. Adding appearance-none removes iOS’ default styling for the input.\n\n<input class=\"appearance-none ring ring-cyan-400\" />",
