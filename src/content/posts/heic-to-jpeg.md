If you have a `.heic` image on your Mac that you’d like to convert into a `.jpeg`, it’s really easy to do so without installing any outside tools or using any websites.

First, open Finder (it should be the leftmost app in your app dock), and locate the photo (if it’s on your desktop, find it in the Desktop folder; if it’s in Documents, find it in your Documents folder, etc).

Once you’ve found the HEIC image, right-click on it (usually that’s a two-finger click), hover over Quick Actions, and then click on Convert Image.

From there, choose your options and click Convert to JPEG.

That’s it! Your new JPEG image will be created in the same folder that the original HEIC photo is.
