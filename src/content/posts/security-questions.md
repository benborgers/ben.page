One thing about me is that I make up answers to security questions.

What was the name of your childhood pet? Pear.

What was the name of the street you grew up on? Recessed Lighting.

I just put in any word that pops into my mind as I’m creating an account. Then, I write it down in my [password manager](https://vault.elk.sh).

You see, I’m never quite sure what the answers to these security questions are gonna allow someone to do. But I want to avoid a situation where knowing the name of the street I grew up on — something probably trivial to figure out with a Google search — can give you the keys to my account.

Plus, with all the blog posts I’ve written here, who knows what information about my life I’ve divulged to the internet forever. So I just treat it like another random password. Plus, I get a kick out of typing in nonsensical answers.
