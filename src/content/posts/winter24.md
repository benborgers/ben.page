A year ago, I [wrote](/winter23) a list of the projects I wanted to get done over winter break. Now that we've reached my final winter break ever (!!), I have made another list.

For myself:

- A first version of [War Room](https://war.elk.sh/home) v2
- Planning how we'll build [JumboSmash](https://github.com/jumbosmash/tradition) 2025 in the spring semester
- Planning [JumboCode](/jumbocode)'s spring events schedule

For others:

- Rebuilding a [JumboCode](/jumbocode) project for a team that didn't finish last year
- Helping build a new [jumbocode.org](https://jumbocode.org)
- Building a small static website for a friend of a friend
- Launching fancy DNS changes for [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com) custom web archive domains (quite literally 1 more line of code is needed, and I've been sitting on this for months)
- Building a custom nameserver system for [Buttondown](https://buttondown.com) sending domains

I’ve got until January 14th. I’ll cross things off as I go!
