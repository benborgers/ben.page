The new thing for note-taking apps is that you can link your notes together with “bi-directional links” — if you link from one note to another note, the other note also indicates that it was linked _to_ by the first note.

That’s the idea behind apps like [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), and [Reflect](https://reflect.app). The bi-directional linking model is supposed to be a better representation of how your brain works: thoughts with connections between them. And if you put enough of yourself into one of these note-taking apps, you’re promised a beautiful _graph view_ showing the different notes and their connections:

An example graph view from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). Not mine though. I don’t have that kind of diligence.

I’ve played with a lot of these kinds of note-taking apps before, but I always end up falling off the wagon. I never really get into creating and maintaining a web of thoughts like this, and my graph view always looks sad: either a bunch of individual notes with not a lot of connections, or forced connections between notes that don’t really feel that helpful (but look pretty when graphed!).

But through writing this blog, I think I’ve come to the simple reason why these apps didn’t work out for me: I didn’t have enough notes in the note-taking app. I didn't have enough thoughts in there in the first place.

It’s a simple conclusion. But in order to graph your thoughts in a note-taking app, you have to write your thoughts down. And that’s easier said than done.

It’s a lot of work to pour all the thoughts that you have into a note-taking app, and to remember to keep that up to date as your brain comes up with new ideas or gathers new information.

Writing in a note-taking app is solitary. You’re the only one who will ever read and edit any of it. Whether you pour out your thoughts and connect them to become a _better thinker_ or not — you’re the only one who will ever know.

But newly, with this blog, I’m forced to churn out a certain rate of things since I’m writing every day. It’s a cadence of putting-thoughts-into-writing that I never had with a note-taking app. And as a result, I’m finding that my thoughts naturally overlap and connect to one another.

I’m finding an urge to sometimes link from one blog post to another, when the ideas naturally connect.

However, I don’t think this is just an idea that I can bring back to one of those note-taking apps and produce a Productivity YouTuber-worthy web of connected thoughts. _Just write more thoughts down!_

Instead, I think my writing output on this blog only really works because it’s a performance.

On this blog, I’m aware that it’s getting published somewhere. A handful of other people will read it. And that public performance pressure makes me write a lot more, since I’ve committed to writing daily. It’s like the feeling that you get when you should be doing work in public but you’re procrastinating instead: _Maybe someone’s watching me make a fool of myself. I should probably just do my work._

So thank you, reader. Whether you’re there or not, the thought of other people reading this blog motivates me to write more — in order to not embarrass myself and miss my goal of writing every day. And I think that’s good for me. So thank you.
