There’s this [tweet](https://twitter.com/beeple/status/1080846910016102405) I came across a while ago:

> i guarantee you have a lot more ideas in you than you think.

I think that’s one of the biggest things I’ve learned by writing daily blog posts. That setting a deadline cadence that feels _just_ out of reach actually forces you to stretch yourself to reach it. And over time, if you keep doing it, it becomes easier.

Having to write a post each day stretches me to find ideas where I would’ve normally not found any. It makes me look at parts of life that I usually observe from inside my head and to make those thoughts tangible.

When it’s just me against a deadline that’s coming _that day_, the only way to beat that deadline is to be creative and to think of something. Not every idea that’s forced out is a good one, but you have a lot more ideas than you think, and some of them are bound to be decent.
