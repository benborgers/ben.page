Last month, I built myself a new to-do list app that I called “tmrw”.

The novel idea was that each task could have a duration and time attached to it, and then you could see your tasks for the next few days laid out on a calendar.

It was mostly an experiment to see whether I could build my own version of [Amie](https://amie.so), stripped back to only include the features I’d need. The “plain text” look of it was inspired by [Plain Text Sports](https://plaintextsports.com).

The UI was definitely cryptic — I built it for myself, so things were hidden behind unlabelled buttons and some buttons didn’t look like they’d be clickable.

My hypothesis for the app was that putting things onto a calendar would help me feel less overwhelmed, because I’d see that I had enough time to do everything I had to do.

I used it for a couple weeks before realizing that my hypothesis was wrong: it didn’t really help me to put things on a calendar. I wasn’t feeling less overwhelmed.

I found myself not putting most things onto the calendar, since I wasn’t sure when I’d work on them. When I did add them to the calendar at a specific time, I found myself blowing past the start time and then feeling discouraged that I was behind.

Part of it was definitely that my app wasn’t as slick as it could be — I didn’t build drag-and-drop moving of events since that seemed hard, so moving things around in time was cumbersome.

In the end, I had a fun couple weeks building the app! I’ll probably take it down soon so I don’t have to keep paying the server bill, but I had a good time along the way.
