I realized while buying a new pair of shoes with Trisha today that my instinct is to refuse when offered to sign up for a store’s rewards program in exchange for a discount.

But as I was checking out, I realized that my instinct to refuse is probably unfounded. I’ve always worried that I’m going to give them my information and they’re going to hound me forever with promotions, but that isn’t really a problem.

1. I use [HEY](https://www.hey.com) for my email, and immediately [screened this store’s emails out](https://www.hey.com/features/the-screener/) as soon as I received their first email.
2. You can always (or at least legally should always be able to) stop texts by replying with “STOP” or something similar.

So I’m not sure why I always refuse. It seems like a decent deal to accept.

I think this is going to be a new phase for me. A sort of renaissance where I sign up for lots of rewards programs.
