There’s something insane about creating apps for the web. It’s the fact that your creation is immediately available to practically anybody, anywhere around the world, without needing them to download anything.

Sure, native phone apps are often smoother, and can send you notifications and see your calendar and integrate deeply into everything.

But the web is ubiquitous. There’s no requirements for the version of your device, or what kind of device you have. Anything you create for the web will work on basically any device, for free, in less than a second.

When I think about it that way, I’m really glad that so far I’ve accidentally “specialized” in making things for the web. It feels like a good medium.
