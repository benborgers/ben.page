title: First Name Usernames

I’m really jealous of people who can get their first name as a username. For obvious reasons, it’s a bit difficult for me.

The only thing that I can remember that I have **ben** as the username for is my username for [Glow](https://glow.app), the crypto wallet I’m working at this summer: I managed to snag **ben.glow**, which I’m very happy about.

But since Ben isn’t exactly a unique name, being able to get that first name username is quite elusive for me.

When I was a lot younger, I defaulted to **bborgers**. It was mimicking my dad, who uses **cborgers** as his username for most things.

But I realized that **bborgers** does not look as good as **cborgers**, so I transitioned to **benborgers** for everything that I can. On Twitter, GitHub, my email, and this website, that’s the username. In the end, I’m grateful that I have a unique enough full name that I can at least get firstnamelastname as a username.
