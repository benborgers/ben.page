JumboCode is a club at Tufts that I’ve [written about before](/jumbocode-learnings). They form about a dozen teams of 10ish developers, and spend the year building an app for a non-profit.

Most of the developers don’t have a lot of experience building apps (mostly for the web, but some mobile), but people learn fast.

A few days ago, I was accepted to be JumboCode’s Head of Engineering for next year!

I have some ideas right now of things I want to do next year. I know it’s a bit silly, because everyone always has big ideas until they realize the constraints, but I also want to preserve where my mind is at.

## Weaknesses

- In my mind, one of JumboCode’s weak points is that there are roughly 2x more people who apply than are able to be accepted.
  - The number of teams, and therefore number of developers that can be accepted, is bottlenecked by how many teams the club’s executive board can manage and check in with.
  - But this means that there are many people who’d like to do JumboCode but are denied.

## Workshops

- I’ve been thinking about the idea of holding workshops a few times a month on the technologies that are often used in JumboCode teams: JavaScript, TypeScript, React, CSS, Tailwind CSS (?), Node.js.
  - These workshops would be available for JumboCode developers, but also to the wider Tufts audience.
    - This way, JumboCode could reach more people and give them a taste of app development, without putting a strain on the existing system.
    - These people might not have been accepted, or want to commit to the club for a year, but maybe they’ve heard that [React](https://react.dev) is a good thing to know and want to spend an evening doing a workshop on it.
- I’m thinking that these workshops should involve a lot of coding along, and trying to keep the “lecturing” to a minimum.
  - People seem to learn quite well by seeing an example and then back-applying it to what they’re trying to do.
    - This is faster and more interesting than learning the fundamentals, _in the beginning_.
      - In the beginning, the goal is to get people to an “ah-ha! this is fun!” moment, not to teach them “the right way”.
  - I think it would make sense to use something like [Replit](https://replit.com), so that we don’t have to spend 20 minutes getting everyone to download VS Code and getting their environment set up.

## Extended Workshops

- I’d love to hold workshops on how to build _apps_, in addition to the ones on basic _technologies_.
- These would have to maintain a fairly low barrier to entry; I don’t think you can assume that everyone coming to these has a “prerequisite” of attending the above workshops.
- The thing is that the “thing” that you build should be _inherently interesting by itself_.
  - The goal is to show people that programming is a fun and creative form of self-expression, not just something you do for classes or for corporations.
  - The canonical idea I keep coming back to is to do a workshop building **an AI-powered chatbot that connects to your Google Calendar and you can talk to it about your calendar**.
    - I like this idea, because I think that it’s a compelling thing to build — if you built it, you’d find it cool to walk out of the workshop with that.
      - This doesn’t happen when you build a tic-tac-toe game (sorry).
- I used to do these events at Home Depot in elementary school on the weekend where they’d provide a little kit of wood and nails and screws, and they’d teach you how to build a little thing.
  - The “thing” was like a birdhouse, a piggy bank, etc.
  - The things you built were compelling by themselves, and you’d walk out with this little cool thing.
  - (By the way, this was definitely a ploy to get parents to come to Home Depot on the weekends. Lure them in with the free entertainment, buy some stuff while you’re at it.)
- You could bring down the level required to build a lot of this stuff by pre-building simpler APIs on top of existing ones.
  - For the example above, I think I would abstract the Google Calendar API (and provide the code to those who are interested) and give it a nicer API layer.
  - But I _wouldn’t_ abstract away the OpenAI API I think, because it’s cool to see how simple that one is inherently.
    - And that’s the “cool thing” for this project; you don’t want to abstract away people’s sense that they did something cool by themselves.

## Events

- In my interview, I was asked whether I had any other ideas for events other than these workshops.
- I told them maybe we could invite speakers on Zoom?
- The example I mentioned was [Fred K. Schott](https://twitter.com/fredkschott), co-creator of the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework. I’ve chatted with him a tiny bit over Twitter messages, and he studied CS at Tufts, so maybe he’d be down to talk to us on Zoom for a bit?
- The question is how many people would be interested in something like this. Personally, _I_ would love it and be very interested in going, but I don’t know how many people at Tufts think something like this is cool.

### Budget

JumboCode needs some more budget. This year, they started giving teams $100/year stipend to go have fun. That’s <$10/person, for the whole year. I feel like it should be _slightly_ higher, if possible.

(I don’t know much about the Tufts club funding process, but I feel like it’s a big enough club that it should be able to command some funding clout.)

It would also be nice to have enough money to get some pizzas for the aforementioned events ($10 per pizza at Costco! And their pizzas are big!).

## Show & Tell?

- It would be cool to have some sort of _“platform”_ for people to share what sorts of projects they’re working on.
- There’s a Tufts Side Projects Collective, which is hosted on Piazza, but not a lot of people post there.
  - I think it’s scary to put yourself out there like that.
- I think a better way would be to make this _”platform”_ a newsletter (of sorts? it doesn’t have to be a classic email newsletter) that I “curate”.
  - That way, I “interview” people about their projects, and it’s _me_ putting them out there, not them putting themselves out there.
    - There’s also hopefully a bit less fear when someone else picks you and qualifies your work as “good enough” to be shared.
      - You don’t have to fear looking stupid.

### In-person

I think the board this year was also looking for things to do in the first 10-15 minutes of the all-club meetings on Sunday nights.

This could be something for that! Have someone come up and talk about their side-project for a bit, or if they don’t want to, someone from the Board talk about it for them.
