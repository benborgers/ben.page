Hello! Iâ€™m <span class="font-handwriting font-medium">Ben Borgers</span>, a rising senior at Tufts University studying computer science.

This summer, I'm interning at [Notion](https://notion.so/product) in NYC. I'm also a support engineer at [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email). Previously, I worked on the Android app at [Locket](https://locket.camera).

At Tufts, I'm the president of [JumboCode](https://jumbocode.org), a club of 180 students that builds software for non-profits. I will also TA for [CS 40](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/40), Machine Structures and Assembly Language Programming, in the coming year.
