Hello! Iâ€™m <span class="font-handwriting font-medium">Ben Borgers</span>, a senior at Tufts University studying computer science.

I'm an engineer at [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email). Previously, I interned at [Notion](https://notion.so/product), [Locket](https://locket.camera), and [Luma](https://lu.ma).

At Tufts, I'm the president of [JumboCode](https://jumbocode.org), a club of 170 students that builds software for non-profits. I also TA for [CS 40](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/40): _Machine Structure and Assembly Language Programming_.
