I think I have an eye for design.

Unfortunately, this is different from being _able_ to design. That is something that I’m not really able to do.

I find it difficult to come up with new and novel designs. Or to design things that look completely different from the rest of my work or fit a specific vibe. It seems like magic when people can invent visual styles that work perfectly for the problem at hand.

Instead, my only ability is that I can tell when something looks bad. When something looks misaligned, or too crowded, or just _off_. Or when something looks amateurish.

Sometimes I don’t really know how to make a website I’ve made look better. I just know that the current version I’ve made looks _bad_.

So sometimes, the only solution is to try again. When all you can do is judge the end result, the only solution is to create a new end result. And to keep trying until it, for whatever reason, feels good.
