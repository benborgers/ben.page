Before this past semester I decided to put myself to a challenge: no dessert from the dining halls for the entire semester.

I even made [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LhZgB-AMSOBz21-hqI0MY-qPtUj7pWxDbF2lJ1QdfJk) to track it!

And I did it! I made it for the entire semester without getting any dessert from dining halls or dining-hall-adjacent establishments at Tufts.

## Why?

Last year, I noticed the progression of eating dessert at the dining hall. At first, it would be a nice treat. But eventually I would come to expect dessert, and a meal felt incomplete without it.

That felt unhealthy. Dessert with every meal probably isn’t a healthy way to be eating.

## Why cold turkey?

I find that I’m more able to stick with things when they’re all-or-nothing. This could’ve been “eat dessert only once a week,” but that’s harder for my brain to reason about.

_Never_ having dessert at the dining halls is extremely easy to think about. There’s nothing to remember, and no gray area.

## Did it have noticeable effects?

Not really?

Every once in a while there was a dessert that looked quite good, and it was kinda a bummer that I couldn’t have it. But that wasn’t super common. (And to be clear, I still ate unhealthy stuff outside of the dining halls at times.)

But I didn’t really feel a difference, neither positive or negative really. The vast majority of days I didn’t think about it at all.

## Did I learn anything?

Of course, I’d like to say yes, but let’s be reasonable here.

I’ll probably go back to eating dessert next semester. In smaller amounts? Perhaps.

At least, if I feel myself sliding back into the feeling of _needing_ dessert in order to make a meal complete, I’ll be able to think back to this experience and hopefully course-correct a bit.
