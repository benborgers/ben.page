I finished my semester yesterday! After a busy whirlwind of a semester, I'm excited to throw myself into some projects over winter break.

While I was supposed to be studying for my finals, I put together a list of projects I want to ship over this break. It's quite ambitious, but I was in an ambitious mood.

- ~~Building a Christmas present for Trisha,~~ [~~Christian~~](https://cbernier.com)~~,~~ [~~Jerome~~](https://jero.zone)~~, and my parents~~
- ~~Rebuilding this blog (~~[~~ben.page~~](https://ben.page)~~) and consolidating~~ [~~benborgers.com~~](https://benborgers.com) ~~into it~~
- Building a birthday present I promised to Christian and Jerome back in August/September and then never finished
- ~~Govcentives, a SaaS I'm building with Jerome~~ _(working on it! making good progress!)_
- ~~An update to~~ [~~War Room~~](https://war.elk.sh) ~~that shows everybody's to-do list for today on the left sidebar~~ _(built it, tested it, decided not to change it)_
- Re-doing the website for Bite _(decided not to do this after all)_

Also, a bit of "tending the garden":

- ~~Moving a client's app to a better/cheaper hosting option~~

I've got from now until January 16th. I'll cross things off as I go!
