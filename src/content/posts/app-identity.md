I bounce around productivity apps, and I don’t like that.

I bounce from Notion to Craft to Goodnotes to Obsidian to something-I-built-myself and back again. I can’t stick to one thing.

My notes are fragmented across apps. Things aren’t all in one place. I don’t have the mythical “second brain” app where every thought I’ve ever had is written down and searchable.

It feels like I want my identity to be attached to one app. That I use one app, and it’s my go-to. A piece of my identity. It’s really similar to how [my brain wants “default stacks”](https://benborgers.com/posts/2022-01-13#my-brain-wants-%E2%80%9Cdefault-stacks%E2%80%9D).

But I think that I have to accept that that just won’t happen for me. I enjoy testing out new stuff too much; a shiny new app comes around, or I just want the features back from an app I used to use, so I switch.

And at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter! I _feel_ like it matters that my notes are all located in the same app, but I’ve also never had an issue remembering which app I was using when I took those notes. It’s a problem that I’ve never actually had. For some reason, my memory for “where did I take these notes” seems quite strong.

So at the end of the day, maybe my “identity” (for myself, in my own brain) _is_ jumping around from app to app when I feel like I want to. I’ll keep doing that. It makes me happy.
