I wanted to build an ask-for-help form into an app that my [**JumboCode**](/f0548db316404315b2f8cbfa3b375732) team built, in case the client had questions after we handed it off:

{% video content="public/posts/forms/demo.mp4" /%}

But in true fashion, I decided to over engineer it. I thought, _What if I had a little site that I could use to generate forms for anything?_, and [forms.ben.page](https://forms.ben.page) was born.

I just configure a bit of JSON, and it spits out another page that I can use.

Currently the responses go to [LogSnag](https://logsnag.com), but I’m thinking of migrating it to just send me a Discord notification instead.

Look, this was definitely overkill and the chance that I use this again for another form is quite slim. But I had a bit of fun building it! And that’s not a bad outcome.
