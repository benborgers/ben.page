title: “If I had to do web development as a job I’d end myself”

That was a bit of a strange statement from a fellow computer science major a few weeks ago.

He continued: "I feel like after I learned React and that stuff I kinda got it. And after that it was just repetitive."

Personally, I *love* web development. He knew that, so it was a bit of a strange comment. But I kept my mouth shut.

**Why the discrepancy between our opinions?**

I think that, to him, web development is the pure skill of building websites and web applications. Snapping together React components.

But to me, web development is a means for building things. The part that I enjoy is *thinking of what* to make, *making it*, and then *giving it to other people*.

The web is a convenient medium for that — I know how to work with the web well, and I can publish my work on the web to lots of people very easily. But the web is just the medium for the creative expression.

I must confess that I agree with him: snapping together React components is relatively dull. It's the process of figuring out what I can build, whether it be something that's [fun](/wrapped), [useful](/bagel-institute), or [hopefully both](https://war.elk.sh/home), that's attractive to me.

It's a bit like having a hobby building furniture. My favorite parts are designing what to make, the process of making it, and seeing others try it. He learned how to cut wood, got the hang of it, and then got bored.

Which is fine! To each their own. But I do love web development, using it as a medium for creativity, and I *will* be staying alive in order to continue enjoying it.
