I wanted to have spellcheck in VS Code for when I was writing blog posts in markdown or README files.

Turns out, there's an easy extension for that! Just install [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright), and it'll check the spelling of your plaintext and markdown documents, and even in code comments.
