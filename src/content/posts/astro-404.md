You can add a 404 not found page for your [Astro](https://astro.build) website just by creating a normal Astro page at `src/pages/404.astro`.

Most static hosting services ([Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Vercel](https://vercel.com), etc) will pick this page up as a 404 page, and show it when there's no matching page at a given URL.
