A lot of my projects are under the domain `elk.sh`. When I don’t want to buy a new domain for a project, I stick it as a subdomain under `elk.sh` — you can even [see all the projects](https://elk.sh/) under that domain.

It’s really all about having something as short as possible, so that the final domain (`something.elk.sh`) isn’t too long.

I first bought the domain in the summer of 2018, in the summer between freshman and sophomore years of high school.

I was taking inspiration from the hosting service `now.sh` from ZEIT (which has since rebranded to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)), which would let you assign your projects a `something.now.sh` subdomain.

I wanted my own version of that, where I could choose any subdomain without other people having already claimed all the good ones.

`.sh` is a top-level domain ending that’s meant for the British Overseas Territory of Saint Helena, but in practice it’s used for a lot of tech projects because the popular programming language Bash uses files that end in `.sh` (like `my-script.sh`).

So I went on a search for three letter words that were available `.sh` domains. Eventually I came across the name `elk`, nabbed it, and here we are today.

It’s honestly not the best name — `elk.sh` is a pretty arbitrary string of letters. But it doesn’t really seem to have mattered. When users have cared enough, for example with [Blocks](https://benborgers.com/posts/blocks) (`blocks.elk.sh`) in high school, they’ve committed the letters to memory well enough.
