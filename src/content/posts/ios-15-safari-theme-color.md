On the iOS 15 update of Safari, there's a colored top bar in the background at the top of the screen.

You can change what color this is by setting a `theme-color` meta property in the `<head>` of the HTML page:

```html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#EF4444" />
```

This will change the color of the section of the interface behind the status bar, above the website itself.
