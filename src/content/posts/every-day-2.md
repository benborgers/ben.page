title: "It Does Have to Be Every Day"

I wrote a couple weeks ago about how _[It Doesn’t Have to Be Every Day](https://benborgers.com/posts/every-day)._

But there _are_ a lot of times when doing something every day is immensely helpful. It catalyzes me to do things that I otherwise wouldn’t find time to do.

For example: this blog. If I didn’t keep a [streak](https://benborgers.com/posts/streaks) of writing a blog post every day, I probably wouldn’t do it nearly as often. Even though it’s something that I want to do (and I’m always glad afterwards that I have a backlog of blog posts), I need a daily cadence in order to keep me on track. I’m not sure how long I can keep this pace up, but it’s held so far.

Or my daily journal entry since December 2019: at this point, what keeps me motivated for doing that is that I can’t bear having a gap in the entries. The guilt of not doing it pushes me to keep up that habit, and I’m _immensely_ happy looking back that I’ve kept it up.

Or lastly, keeping up with studying my flashcards for Chinese class bit by bit every day. If I told myself that I’d study the flashcards “whenever I have time”, I wouldn’t do it much at all. But by creating a daily recurring task for it, I somehow find time to do it every day. I work it into my routine by pressure.

There’s of course a danger that adding too many things to the daily routine will become [overwhelming](https://benborgers.com/posts/overwhelmed). In a way, I start every day being behind on work: even if I finished everything yesterday, new tasks have reappeared overnight.

But for now, it’s going okay. As long as I don’t give too many things _every day_ status, it’s a neat trick to get my brain to keep up habits.
