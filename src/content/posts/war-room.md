I’ve started gathering in study rooms in the library at Tufts and doing work at night with friends.

Out of this idea came War Room, a shared to-do list app with friends.

You have your own to-do list in the middle, a list of everybody else on the left (where you can expand their to-do list to see it), and a “Global Feed” of what everybody’s gotten done in the past day on the right.

People can react to tasks on the right side with emoji reactions, and everybody’s allowed a 20-character status that appears under their name on the left side.

I’ve found it really fun and motivating to see what everybody else is up to, and to have other people [celebrate wins](https://twitter.com/benborgers/status/1445456040099680262) with you.
