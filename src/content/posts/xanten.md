My parents and I travelled to Germany and the Netherlands from May 10th, 2024 to May 17th, 2024.

The primary purpose of our trip was to go to a family reunion, which had been organized by one of my aunts and uncles.

## May 11th

We flew in to Amsterdam, picked up a Hertz rental car (a stick shift, which only my dad could drive), and drove two hours from Amsterdam to Xanten, Germany. I napped in the car.

We stayed at an apartment in Xanten, which happened to be next to a Renaissance fair. Parking was difficult.

The dinner tonight was organized by my great-aunt, at the Hotel Zur Linde in Repelen. I met much of my family on my dad's side for the first time in years, including many of my cousins that I haven't talked to in a long time.

The dinner options almost all contained white asparagus, of which I chose the asparagus ravioli.

## May 12th

I woke up at 5:30am because the sun was shining into the living room through a window that did not have a shade. I got back to sleep at 7:30am, and when I woke up again at 10:45am, my parents had left to eat breakfast with my uncle's family at their apartment. I quickly got ready and walked over.

After breakfast, another aunt and uncle joined us, and we walked around Xanten. Eventually we ended up in Xanten's town center and ate lunch there — asparagus risotto, for me.

We parted ways from the uncles and my parents and I visited the Roman ruins in Xanten.

The dinner tonight was at the Neumaier Hotel, which took two hours to produce food which we _did_ select from a menu months ago. My schnitzel was mediocre, but my crème brûlée was fantastic.

After dinner, we went with one uncle's family and my aunt's family to get drinks at a café/bar in Xanten, and then went home.

Today we drove to Cologne to meet a friend of mine who's been working at CERN!

Together, we did a walking tour of Cologne, with a tour guide who was comically unhinged and vulgar. I don't think many of the things he told us on the tour were correct, either. He did tell us many times how much he loves the legal weed in Cologne (and California — his original home).

Today we walked up the 533 steps to the top of the Cologne Cathedral.
