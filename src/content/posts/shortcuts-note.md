I like to create a daily note on my iPad in the Apple Notes app, where I can jot down little things throughout the day.

Today, I created a Shortcut using the built-in Shortcuts app that launches my note for the day, and creates a new note if the daily note doesn’t exist yet.

Here’s the Shortcut that I ended up making:

- Take today’s date and format it according to my liking (“Tuesday, June 7, 2022”).
- Find notes with that date as the title, and set it to a variable called `note`.
- If a note titled with the date exists, open it.
- If it doesn’t exist, create it and open it.

I then added the Shortcut to my dock, so I can just click the icon and open today’s daily note.
