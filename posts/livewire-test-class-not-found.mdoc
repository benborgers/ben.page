You're probably writing a Laravel test for a Livewire component.

[The docs](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/testing) don't seem to mention that you need to import a package at the top of your test file first, like this:

```php
use Livewire\Livewire;
```

Now, you can use `Livewire::test` in your tests!
