ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m trying the idea of _morning pages_, where I write three pages in the morning of whateverâ€™s on my mind. Itâ€™s mostly for me, but Iâ€™m publishing them too because why not.

Good morning! This time, itâ€™s raining and the wind is howling.

## The blogs are spreading!

My friend Ian blessed me yesterday with this wonderful text:

I set him up with a small server and [Ghost](https://ghost.org), essentially the same setup I use to run this blog. We bought the domain [tunnington.com](https://tunnington.com) (named for his wonderful middle name), and Iâ€™m really excited to see what he writes.

## Second semester is looming

I think Iâ€™m going to go back to Tufts on Tuesday night, so I can do the first three days of classes (which are virtual) from my dorm room. I think itâ€™ll be easier to flip my brain back into school mode that way.

Hereâ€™s how I want those days to look:

### Wednesday

On Wednesday, I only have one class and itâ€™s at 3pm. This is prime opportunity for sleeping in and laziness. But no! New semester, new me.

I will wake up at 7am, get ready and get some kind of food (I donâ€™t need to eat it â€” I just need to [use all of my meal swipes](https://benborgers.com/swipes)).

Then Iâ€™ll work for the day from the tiny office I rented near Tufts (yes, I rented a small office. Itâ€™s an experiment. Donâ€™t come for me. Iâ€™ll probably write more about this in the future), come back by 3pm, and take _Data Structures_ virtually from my dorm room (the office does not have sufficiently trustworthy wifi at the moment).

### Thursday

On Thursday, I have three classes! And the first one is at 9am, which provides _fantastic_ motivation for getting out of bed.

I will wake up at 7am again, get ready, and burn some of those sweet sweet meal swipes yet again (if necessary).

Then Iâ€™ll attend my two morning classes virtually from my dorm (_Bridge to Higher Mathematics_ and _Intro to World Music_). I have a lengthy break from 11:45am to 4:30pm during which I should map out what I wanna get done (if a lack of schoolwork presents itself, then freelance programming is a great option). Then Iâ€™ll attend my last class of the day, _Intermediate Chinese_.

### Friday

On Fridays I have no classes.

But is that a free pass for laziness? **No!**

Current-me is very confident that I will _not_ be lazy on Friday, and that I will wake up at 7am (of course!). I will get ready, use up meal swipes, and walk to my office (Do. Not. Come. For. Me. The office is an _experiment_) to do some work for the day.

## Office? What office?

Okay, I wasnâ€™t planning on writing about this in this post, but I guess thereâ€™s a couple reasons I should:

1.  This is the first time Iâ€™ve mentioned it in one of these posts. If you didnâ€™t realize that, you arenâ€™t reading closely enough, and should go back and review the material.
2.  I need to hit that sweet sweet three-page word count for this morningâ€™s post, and am desperate for something to write about.

So yeah, I rented a tiny office near Tufts last month.

Itâ€™s really a tiny room in a construction park, about a half-hour walk away from Tufts.

Iâ€™ve wanted my own office since middle school, so Iâ€™m telling myself that this is an experiment to see whether I actually want one. Itâ€™s not exceedingly expensive, and it gives me a dedicated place where I only do work.

The only barrier is whether Iâ€™ll actually go there â€” a half-hour walk both ways is a bit hefty. But Iâ€™d like to rebrand it to _exercise_ instead, and now my problems are all gone.

Plus, I think the walk might serve as a bit of a centering exercise â€” if Iâ€™m taking the time to walk here, I might as well actually get done what I wanted to get done and then leave sooner rather than later.

Of course, this is all purely hypothetical. Itâ€™s quite cold right now in the Boston area, so whether Iâ€™m so excited about the half-hour commute remains to be seen.

But ideally, Iâ€™d like the office to be the place where I go in the mornings on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I donâ€™t have class until 3pm. On Fridays, I donâ€™t have classes at all.

Thereâ€™s a real risk of those mornings just slipping away into nothingness as the semester goes on, but if I can drag myself to an office early in the morning, I think Iâ€™ll be able to crank out a solid couple hours of work before returning to campus for a late lunch.

**The other tool for keeping me on track?** You, dear reader. I canâ€™t embarrass myself in front of _the audience_. Whether youâ€™re there or not, thereâ€™s accountability. Speaking of which:

## Presenting... todayâ€™s to-doâ€™s!

*   \[x\] Do some freelance work for [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email). Ideally, Iâ€™d like to get my current project in a presentable state.
*   \[x\] Read the article I have to read for _Intro to World Music_. Getting my first homework assignment this morning in my email inbox hit me like a truck.
*   \[ \] Read 3 more chapters of _The Anthropocene Reviewed_.
